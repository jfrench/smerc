#' Binary adjacency matrix for \code{neast}
#'
#' A binary adjacency matrix for the \code{neast} data set.
#' Some of the islands (e.g., Nantucket) are considered
#' adjacent to the mainland because of ferries traveling
#' from certain mainland regions to these islands. Manual
#' connections were added for many of the New York counties
#' because they are on islands.
