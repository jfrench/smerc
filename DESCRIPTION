Description: Implements statistical methods for analyzing the counts of areal data,
    with a focus on the detection of spatial clusters and clustering.  The package
    has a heavy emphasis on spatial scan methods, which were first introduced
    by Kulldorff and Nagarwalla (1995) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780140809> and
    Kulldorff (1997) <doi:10.1080/03610929708831995>.
