\title{Spatial Scan Test}
\usage{
scan.test(coords, cases, pop, ex = sum(cases)/sum(pop) * pop,
  type = "poisson", nsim = 499, alpha = 0.1, nreport = nsim + 1,
  ubpop = 0.5, lonlat = FALSE, parallel = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{An \eqn{n \times 2} matrix of centroid coordinates for the regions..}

\item{cases}{The number of cases in each region.}

\item{pop}{The population size of each region.}

\item{ex}{The expected number of cases for each region.  The default is calculated under the constant risk hypothesis.}

\item{type}{The type of scan statistic to implement.  Default is "poisson".  Alternative is "bernoulli".}

\item{nsim}{The number of simulations from which to compute p-value.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level to determine whether a cluster is signficant.  Default is 0.05.}

\item{nreport}{The frequency with which to report simulation progress.  The default is \code{nsim+ 1}, meaning no progress will be displayed.}

\item{ubpop}{The upperbound of the proportion of the total population to consider for a cluster.}

\item{lonlat}{If lonlat is TRUE, then the great circle distance is used to calculate the intercentroid distance.  The default is FALSE, which specifies that Euclidean distance should be used.}

\item{parallel}{A logical indicating whether the test should be parallelized using the \code{parallel::mclapply function}.  Default is TRUE.  If TRUE, no progress will be reported.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of length two of class spscan. The first element (clusters) is a list containing the significant, non-ovlappering clusters, and has the the following components:
\item{coords}{The centroid of the significant clusters.}
\item{r}{The radius of the window of the clusters.}
\item{pop}{The total population in the cluser window.}
\item{cases}{The observed number of cases in the cluster window.}
\item{expected}{The expected number of cases in the cluster window.}
\item{smr}{Standarized mortaility ratio (observed/expected) in the cluster window.}
\item{rr}{Relative risk in the cluster window.}
\item{loglikrat}{The loglikelihood ratio for the cluster window (i.e., the log of the test statistic).}
\item{pvalue}{The pvalue of the test statistic associated with the cluster window.}
The second element of the list is the centroid coordinates.  This is needed for plotting purposes.

\description{
\code{scan.test} performs the spatial scan test of Kulldorf (1997).
}
\details{
The test is performed using the spatial scan test based on the Poisson test statistic and a fixed number of cases.  The windows are circular and extend from the observed data locations.  The clusters returned are non-overlapping, ordered from most significant to least significant.  The first cluster is the most likely to be a cluster.  If no significant clusters are found, then the most likely cluster is returned (along with a warning).

\examples{
data(nydf)
coords = with(nydf, cbind(longitude, latitude))
out = scan.test(coords = coords, cases = floor(nydf$cases),
                  pop = nydf$pop, alpha = 0.12, lonlat = TRUE)
## plot output for new york state

mapargs = list(database = "state", region = "new york",

# a second example to match the results of Waller and Gotway (2005)
# in chapter 7 of their book (pp. 220-221).
# Note that the 'longitude' and 'latitude' used by them has
# been switched.  When giving their input to SatScan, the coords
# were given in the order 'longitude' and 'latitude'.
# However, the SatScan program takes coordinates in the order
# 'latitude' and 'longitude', so the results are slightly different
# from the example above.
coords = with(nydf, cbind(y, x))
out2 = scan.test(coords = coords, cases = floor(nydf$cases),
                  pop = nydf$pop, alpha = 0.12, lonlat = TRUE)
# the cases observed for the clusters in Waller and Gotway: 117, 47, 44
# the second set of results match
c(out2$clusters[[1]]$cases, out2$clusters[[2]]$cases, out2$clusters[[3]]$cases)
