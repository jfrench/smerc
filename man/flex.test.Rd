\title{Flexibly Shaped Spatial Scan Test}
\usage{
flex.test(coords, cases, pop, w, k = 10, ex = sum(cases)/sum(pop) * pop,
  type = "poisson", nsim = 499, alpha = 0.1, nreport = nsim + 1,
  lonlat = FALSE, parallel = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{An \eqn{n \times 2} matrix of centroid coordinates for the regions.}

\item{cases}{The number of cases observed in each region.}

\item{pop}{The population size associated with each region.}

\item{w}{A binary spatial adjacency matrix.}

\item{k}{An integer indicating the maximum number of regions to inclue in a potential cluster.  Default is 10}

\item{ex}{The expected number of cases for each region.  The default is calculated under the constant risk hypothesis.}

\item{type}{The type of scan statistic to implement.  Default is \code{"poisson"}.  Only \code{"poisson"} is currently implemented.}

\item{nsim}{The number of simulations from which to compute the p-value.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level to determine whether a cluster is signficant.  Default is \code{0.10}.}

\item{nreport}{The frequency with which to report simulation progress.  The default is \code{nsim+ 1}, meaning no progress will be displayed.}

\item{lonlat}{The default is \code{FALSE}, which specifies that Euclidean distance should be used.If \code{lonlat} is \code{TRUE}, then the great circle distance is used to calculate the intercentroid distance.}

\item{parallel}{A logical indicating whether the test should be parallelized using the \code{parallel::mclapply function}.  Default is \code{TRUE}.  If \code{TRUE}, no progress will be reported.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of length two of class scan. The first element (clusters) is a list containing the significant, non-ovlappering clusters, and has the the following components: 
\item{coords}{The centroid of the significant clusters.}
\item{r}{The radius of the window of the clusters.}
\item{pop}{The total population in the cluser window.}
\item{cases}{The observed number of cases in the cluster window.}
\item{expected}{The expected number of cases in the cluster window.}
\item{smr}{Standarized mortaility ratio (observed/expected) in the cluster window.}
\item{rr}{Relative risk in the cluster window.}
\item{loglikrat}{The loglikelihood ratio for the cluster window (i.e., the log of the test statistic).}
\item{pvalue}{The pvalue of the test statistic associated with the cluster window.}
The second element of the list is the centroid coordinates.  This is needed for plotting purposes.

\description{
\code{flex.test} performs the flexibly shaped spatial scan test of Tango and Takahashi (2005).
}
\details{
The test is performed using the spatial scan test based on the Poisson test statistic and a fixed number of cases.  The first cluster is the most likely to be a cluster.  If no significant clusters are found, then the most likely cluster is returned (along with a warning).
