  tpop = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{nsim}{A positive integer indicating the number of
simulations to perform.}

\item{nn}{A list of nearest neighbors produced by \code{\link{nnpop}}.}

\item{ty}{The total number of cases in the study area.}

\item{ex}{The expected number of cases for each region.
The default is calculated under the constant risk
hypothesis.}

\item{type}{The type of scan statistic to compute. The
default is \code{"poisson"}. The other choice
is \code{"binomial"}.}

\item{ein}{The expected number of cases in the zone.
Conventionally, this is the estimated overall disease
risk across the study area, multiplied by the total
population size of the zone.}

\item{eout}{The expected number of cases outside the
zone.  This should be \code{ty - ein} and is computed
automatically if not provided.}

\item{tpop}{The total population in the study area.}

\item{popin}{The total population in the zone.}

\item{popout}{The population outside the zone.  This
should be \code{tpop - popin} and is computed
automatically if not provided.}

\item{cl}{
A cluster object created by \code{\link{makeCluster}},
or an integer to indicate number of child-processes
(integer values are ignored on Windows) for parallel evaluations
(see Details on performance).
It can also be \code{"future"} to use a future backend (see Details),
\code{NULL} (default) refers to sequential evaluation.
}

\item{simdist}{Character string indicating the simulation
distribution. The default is \code{"multinomial"}, which
conditions on the total number of cases observed. The
other options are \code{"poisson"} and \code{"binomial"}}

\item{pop}{The population size associated with each
region.}

\item{min.cases}{The minimum number of cases required for
a cluster.  The default is 2.}

\item{ldup}{A logical vector indicating positions of duplicated zones. Not
intended for user use.}

\item{lseq_zones}{A list of logical vectors specifying the sequence of
relevant zones based on ubpop constraints}
}
\value{
A list with the maximum statistic for each population upperbound for
  each simulated data set. Each element will have a vector of maximums for
  each simulated data set corresponding to the sequence of ubpop values. The
  list will have \code{nsim} elements.
}
\description{
\code{seq_scan_sim} efficiently performs \code{\link{scan.test}} on a
simulated data set.  The function is meant to be used internally by the
\code{\link{optimal_ubpop}} function in the smerc package.
