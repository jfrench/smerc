\title{Scan Statistic}
\usage{
scan.stat(yin, ein, eout, ty, type = "poisson")
}
\arguments{
\item{yin}{The sum of the response values inside the window.  Generally, the sum of the cases.}

\item{ein}{The expected value of the response in the window.  Generally, the estimated overall risk for all regions combined, multiplied by the population size of the window.}

\item{eout}{The expected value of the response outside the window.}

\item{ty}{The sum of all responses in the study area.  Generally, the total number of cases.}

\item{type}{The type of scan statistic to implement.  Currently, only "poisson" is implemented.}
}
\value{
A vector of scan statistics.
}
\description{
\code{scan.stat} calculates the scan statistic for various distributions.
