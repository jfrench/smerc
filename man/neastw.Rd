\title{Binary adjacency matrix for \code{neast}}
\description{
A binary adjacency matrix for the \code{neast} data set.
Some of the islands (e.g., Nantucket) are considered
adjacent to the mainland because of ferries traveling
from certain mainland regions to these islands. Manual
connections were added for many of the New York counties
because they are on islands.
