\title{Breast cancer mortality in the Northeastern United States}
\description{
An \code{\link[sf]{sf}} object containing data related to
breast cancer mortality in the Northeastern United
States.  The data include several variables observed for
245 counties (or similar) as well polygon information defined using
longitude/latitude coordinates in the WGS84 coordinate
system. The following variables are included in the
object:
\itemize{
\item \code{id}: A name-based id for each county.
\item \code{cases}: The number of breast cancer
mortality cases between 1988-1992.
\item \code{population}: The number of residents in the county
based on 1990 U.S. census results.
\item \code{x}: An x coordinate of a centroid associated
with each county provided by Kulldorff et al. (2003). See
Details.
\item \code{y}: A y coordinate of a centroid associated
with each county provided by Kulldorff et al. (2003). See
Details.
}
}
\details{
The \code{x} and \code{y} coordinates define centroids
associated with each county. The coordinates were
provided by Kulldorf et al. (2003). They are appropriate
for computing standard Euclidean intercentroid distance
between counties but are not consistent with the polygon
geometry of the data set.  The coordinate system
of these coordinates is unknown.

Alternative centroids for the geometry can be obtained
using the following commands.

\code{sf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)} \cr
\code{pts <- sf::st_centroid(sf::st_geometry(neast))}
}
\examples{
if (require(sf)) {
data(neast)
plot(st_geometry(neast))
plot(neast["cases"])
}
